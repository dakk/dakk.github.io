<p>Working with opendata and using html5 as framework for your Android apps, will take you to an hard problem: how I can access data hosted in different origin? That's the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy">Same-origin policy problem</a>.</p>
<p>My solution for this problem, use a bi-directional communication between the Android java application and the javascript software, and could be used in different cases; the solution is divided in 3 part of software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android JSInterface that provide an function that prepare and execute a new task.</li>
<li>Android Async Task that start the download and will call a js callback when the download is finished.</li>
<li>Javascript part that call the JSInterface, and provide a callback for the finished download.</li>
</ul>

Before the synth...

## Case & PSU




## Modules

...
Creating my analog synth, I come across the choosing of a good material for modules front panels;
I tried metal, wood, but finally I came across polycarbonate plastic cut with an alternative seghett.
For the new project I chose a clever material, fiberglass: and it is clever because I've found
ready to be used gerber files which i sent directly to a PCB manufactor for cutting / printing.

You can find the files here: https://github.com/baritonomarchetto/3U-Eurorack-Fiberglass-Blank-Panels


The procedure I adopted for creating a module is the following:

1. Create the layout of the front panel in inkscape
2. Create the schematics on paper
3. Print the layout
4. Lay on a clean panel of the adeguate size
5. Use the drill
6. Put connectors
7. Solder the circuit pcb in stripboard
8. Assemble and mount

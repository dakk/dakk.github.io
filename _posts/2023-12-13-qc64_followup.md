In a recent article I wrote, *"Quantum Computing on a Commodore 64 in 200 Lines of BASIC"*, published both on [Medium](https://medium.com/@dakk/quantum-computing-on-a-commodore-64-in-200-lines-of-basic-eda7658b32a4) and [Hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2023/07/04/quantum-computing-on-a-commodore-64-in-200-lines-of-basic/#comments), shows a two-qubit quantum circuit emulator on the venerable Commodore 64, writing only 200 lines of code. The source code, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/dakk/qc64), sparked a flurry of activity in the retro-computing community. Notably, enthusiasts have ported this proof-of-concept (POC) to **6502 assembly**, **Fortran**, and even the **ZX Spectrum**. This follow-up article delves into the implications and the burgeoning community interest.

## The Quantum Challenge on Retro Platforms

The initial project was a testament to the versatility and enduring relevance of classic computing platforms. The Commodore 64, with its limited resources, was pushed to simulate quantum mechanics, a domain typically reserved for high-powered modern computers. This endeavor not only showcases the potential for educational tools in quantum computing but also ignites a conversation about the untapped capabilities of vintage technology.


## Community Response and Expansions

Since the article's publication, the community response has been phenomenal. Programmers and hobbyists have taken the original BASIC code and adapted it to other languages and platforms. Notably:

- [*6502 Assembly Version*](https://github.com/dakk/qc64/pull/4): A more efficient, lower-level implementation that runs faster and uses less memory.
- [*Fortran Iteration*](https://github.com/dakk/qc64/pull/11): Leveraging older scientific computers, this version brings quantum emulation to a range of vintage systems.
- [*ZX Spectrum Adaptation*](https://github.com/dakk/qc64/pull/10): Demonstrating the cross-platform potential, this port brings quantum concepts to a beloved British microcomputer.

These ports are more than just technical achievements; they represent a bridge between the past and future of computing.



## Conclusion

The broad interest in these projects highlights a growing trend: using nostalgic tech to teach cutting-edge concepts. Schools and educational programs, often constrained by budgets, can utilize accessible retro hardware to introduce students to quantum computing principles. This hands-on approach, using tangible and less intimidating platforms, could demystify quantum computing and inspire the next generation of computer scientists.

The journey from a two-qubit quantum circuit emulator on a Commodore 64 to its adaptation across various old-school platforms is just the beginning. This fusion of past and future opens up new avenues for both education and hobbyist exploration. As we continue to push the boundaries of what these vintage machines can do, we're not just revisiting the past; we're redefining the future.

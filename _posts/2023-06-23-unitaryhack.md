This June I emerged as one of the top participants with 9 bounties collected (alongside another exceptional contributor) in the [#UnitaryHack](https://unitaryhack.dev) Hackathon, hosted by the [Unitary Fund](https://unitary.fund/).

For those unfamiliar, the UnitaryHack Hackathon is an event that gathers quantum computing enthusiasts from across the globe to work together and address exciting challenges in the field. It was an journey where I had the opportunity to explore, learn, and contribute to the burgeoning open-source ecosystem of quantum computing.

Here is the list of bounties that I tackled:
- [qiskit-aer: Qiskit Aer still uses execute](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/issues/1632)
- [bqskit: Non-deterministic circuit iteration for regions](https://github.com/bqskit/bqskit/issues/150)
- [qiskit-braket-provider: add get_statevector support for BraketLocalBackend](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider/issues/47)
- [qiskit-braket-provider: Updates for Qiskit to Braket circuit conversion](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-braket-provider/issues/37)
- [pulser: Adding a function to draw SequenceSamples](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser/issues/522)
- [pulser: Drawing of Register goes out of window boundaries](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser/issues/501)
- [pulser: Add an error when a Channel is called with an eom_config but without a modulation bandwidth](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser/issues/497)
- [pulser: SPAM errors introduce large simulation overhead](https://github.com/pasqal-io/Pulser/issues/352)
- [amazon-braket-sdk-python: Support for the run_batch() method on LocalSimulator](https://github.com/aws/amazon-braket-sdk-python/issues/320)

Each of these projects allowed me to dive deeper into quantum computing, tackle real-world problems, and collaborate with an incredible community of passionate learners and experienced professionals. This experience reaffirmed my belief in the power of open-source collaborations and their transformative role in shaping the future of technology.

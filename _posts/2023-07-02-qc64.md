In an age where companies are selling two-qubit quantum computers for a [sum of money](https://www.beyondgames.biz/29903/spinq-is-selling-quantum-computers-to-consumers/) that would make your wallet recoil in horror, here we are, stepping off the beaten path and walking down memory lane to a time when computers were, well, somewhat simpler.

Join me on this delightful journey where we shatter the belief that quantum simulations need groundbreaking technologies. Get ready to be amazed as we simulate two-qubit quantum computing operations on none other than our retro powerhouse, the Commodore 64.

You heard it right! Our beloved Commodore 64, an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982, is ready to show those fancy, pricey quantum computers how it’s done. Let’s roll up our sleeves, dust off those old systems, and dive into the world of quantum simulations!

## The Commodore Quantum Simulator

The Commodore Quantum Simulator is a BASIC program capable of simulating various quantum gate operations on a two-qubit system. With this system, you can simulate operations such as Pauli-X, Pauli-Y, Pauli-Z, Hadamard, CNOT, and he SWAP gate.

Upon launching the simulator, it defaults to the initial state of "|00>". The simulator then prompts for a sequence of quantum gates to be applied. For instance, inputting “H0CX” instructs the simulator to apply the Hadamard gate on qubit 0, followed by a CNOT gate operation. Subsequent to this state manipulation, the simulator proceeds to run a defined number of iterations, simulating the quantum state’s evolution with each step. At the end of this process, it then provides the user with the distribution of quantum states, offering a tangible insight into the fascinating probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.

## Conclusion

Quantum computing might seem like a domain only for the most advanced hardware on the planet. But at its heart, it’s a series of mathematical transformations, all of which are perfectly suited for our good old Commodore 64.

So next time when someone brags about their ultra-advanced quantum computer, remind them gently of the time when you performed quantum simulations on an 8-bit computer from the 1980s. The Commodore 64 might not break any speed records, but it will definitely break some preconceived notions about quantum computing.

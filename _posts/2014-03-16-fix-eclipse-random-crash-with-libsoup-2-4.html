<p>After upgrading libsoup to version 2.4 on funtoo, eclipse began to present random crash while using auto-completation; the fail-log says that the problem is in libsoup.</p>
<p>The fix is easy, just add this line to your eclipse.ini, don't ask me why:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>-Dorg.eclipse.swt.browser.DefaultType=mozilla</em></p></blockquote>

<p>In the aim to merge two of my server on digitalocean, today I tried to write a mod_rewrite rule to redirect a secondary domain to a subfolder. After one hour, I found that I can do that with a VirtualHosts!</p>
<p>Just edit the file /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and add a rule for each domain at the end of file:</p>
<p>&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;<br />
ServerName www.domain.org<br />
DocumentRoot /var/www/vhosts/domain.org/www<br />
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</p>
<p>It's easy, if you know.</p>
